# KIWI Code Generator — `kiwicgen`

The `generator/` directory contains the KIWI OSAL code generator, its CLI and GUI frontends, the generated-source formatter integration, and the runtime resources required by standalone builds.

Both frontends use the same generation core. Generation behavior must not be duplicated in the GUI or CLI.

Generator documentation is maintained at repository level in `doc/kiwicgen.md`.

Responsibilities are intentionally separated:

- `core/model.py` contains frontend-independent configuration/result data and stable capability lists.
- `core/profile.py` loads/saves YAML profiles and validates `kiwicgen-version` constraints.
- `core/paths.py` resolves source/distribution resources and generated output paths.
- `core/validation.py` normalizes and validates configuration shared by CLI, GUI and profiles.
- `core/template_renderer.py` performs OSAL template text transformations and generated CMake/profile rendering.
- `core/generator.py` orchestrates the generation pipeline.
- `core/logging.py` provides the asynchronous log dispatcher shared by frontends.
- `core/version.py` is the single source of the application version.
- `core/errors.py` defines expected kiwicgen error classes.
- `formatter/` owns clang-format resolution and execution.
- `cli/` and `gui/` contain frontend-only behavior.
- `resources/templates/osal/` contains the current OSAL templates.

## Requirements

Python 3.10 or newer is required to run kiwicgen from source or build standalone executables. Runtime and executable-build dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`.

From `generator/`, install source dependencies with:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

`kiwicgen` owns the formatting of generated C sources. The supported formatter baseline is `clang-format` 22.x. The fixed style policy is stored in:

```text
generator/resources/kiwicgen-clang-format.yaml
```

Standalone distributions carry their own formatter executable, style policy and OSAL templates, so target machines do not need a separate Python or clang-format installation.

By default, executable build artifacts are written to repository-root `build/` and `dist/`, one level above `generator/`. `--build-dir` and `--dist-dir` override these locations.

## Running from source

From the repository root:

```bash
python generator/cli/main.py --help
python generator/gui/main.py
```

The installed console entry point is also available after installing the project:

```bash
kiwicgen --help
```

## CLI application

The packaged CLI executable is named `kiwicgen` (`kiwicgen.exe` on Windows).

Running it with no arguments prints help and does not generate files:

```bash
kiwicgen
kiwicgen --help
```

### General options

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print CLI help and exit |
| `--version` | Print the kiwicgen version and exit |
| `--quiet` | Suppress informational generation log messages |
| `--no-color` | Disable colored console log output |
| `--module-prefix=PREFIX` | Prefix used for generated file names, symbols and include guards |
| `--port=PORT` | Select a target backend; repeat to select multiple ports |
| `--language=LANGUAGE` | Select generated language; C is implemented and C++ is planned |
| `--output=DIR` | Output root directory |
| `--fprof=PROFILE.yaml` | Load a kiwicgen generation profile from YAML |

If `--output` is omitted, the CLI writes to `./generated` relative to the current working directory. Output location is intentionally not stored in profiles.

### API selection

The current CLI supports these positive switches:

| Option | API group |
| --- | --- |
| `--use-queue-api` | Queues |
| `--use-stream-buffer-api` | Stream buffers |
| `--use-mutex-api` | Mutexes |
| `--use-semaphore-api` | Counting semaphores |
| `--use-event-flags-api` | Event flags |
| `--use-thread-api` | Threads |
| `--use-critical-section-api` | Critical sections |
| `--use-software-timer-api` | Software timers |
| `--use-time-api` | Time |
| `--use-memory-api` | Memory |

All API groups are disabled by default. Positive CLI switches add groups to those loaded from a profile.

### Output-layout switches

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--split-into-port-dir` | Put portable files below `portable/<port>/` |
| `--split-src-inc-files` | Split `.c` files into `src/` and `.h` files into `include/` |
| `--format-generated-code` | Format generated `.c`/`.h` files with the kiwicgen policy |
| `--no-format-generated-code` | Skip generated-code formatting |

Generated-code formatting is enabled by default.

### CLI examples

Generate a FreeRTOS OSAL with thread and queue APIs:

```bash
kiwicgen \
  --module-prefix=foo_module \
  --port=FreeRTOS \
  --language=C \
  --use-thread-api \
  --use-queue-api
```

Regenerate from a saved profile into another directory:

```bash
kiwicgen \
  --fprof=kiwicgen-foo_module-profile.yaml \
  --output=./regen
```

## YAML generation profiles

A generation profile captures what kiwicgen should generate, not where output is written.

Profiles saved by kiwicgen 0.4.x use this shape:

```yaml
kiwicgen-version: ">=0.4.0,<1.0.0"
module_prefix: foo_module
ports:
  - FreeRTOS
language: C
api:
  queue: true
  stream_buffer: false
  mutex: false
  semaphore: false
  event_flags: false
  thread: true
  critical_section: false
  software_timer: true
  time: false
  memory: false
layout:
  split_into_port_dir: true
  split_src_inc_files: true
format_generated_code: true
```

`kiwicgen-version` is a standard version constraint. The running generator validates it before consuming generation options. Existing compatible 0.x profiles, for example `>=0.2.0,<1.0.0`, remain valid with kiwicgen 0.4.0.

Starting with kiwicgen 1.0.0, profile evolution is intended to preserve backward compatibility within a major release.

The GUI suggests profile names in this form:

```text
kiwicgen-<module_prefix>-profile.yaml
```

### CLI precedence

```text
built-in defaults
       ↓
YAML profile (--fprof)
       ↓
explicit CLI scalar/positive options
```

`--module-prefix`, repeated `--port` and `--language` replace corresponding profile values. Positive API/layout switches can enable additional options. Formatting switches explicitly enable or disable formatting.

## GUI application

The packaged GUI executable is named `kiwicgen-gui` (`kiwicgen-gui.exe` on Windows).

The GUI uses three execution contexts:

```text
Tk/UI main thread
Generation worker thread
Logging listener thread
```

Tk widgets are touched only by the UI thread. Generation and formatter work run outside it, and logs are serialized through thread-safe queues before being displayed by Tk.

The settings area remains compact when the window is resized; extra space is assigned primarily to the generator log.

### Current selectors

Ports:

- FreeRTOS — implemented.
- POSIX — implemented. Queues, stream buffers, recursive mutexes, counting semaphores, event flags, thread operations including explicit `Yield` and `DelayUntil`, native software timers, monotonic time and memory are implemented. Portable thread suspend/resume and the deprecated system-level critical-section primitive are unsupported.

Languages:

- C — implemented.
- C++ — planned, selectable in the GUI, but generation is not implemented yet.


Before starting a generation worker, the GUI validates configuration. At least one port and a language must be selected. Selecting an unimplemented port/language produces both a generator-log error and a GUI error message; generation is not started.

## POSIX port

The generated POSIX port is intended for host/native execution and maps the generic OSAL contract to pthreads, POSIX semaphores, condition variables, POSIX timers and libc services. Queue synchronization uses one native mutex plus two backend-private semaphores, `freeSlotsSmphr` and `busySlotsSmphr`; these internal objects are not generic OSAL semaphores and do not consume semaphore registry slots. Generic OSAL mutexes are always recursive/reentrant on every backend. Stream buffers use a byte ring buffer protected by a native mutex with condition variables for blocked readers and writers. Event flags use a native mutex, condition variable and explicit awaiter bookkeeping.

POSIX timed waits use native blocking primitives rather than polling loops. `ThreadDelayUntil` uses an absolute `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` deadline to avoid accumulating periodic-delay drift, `ThreadYield` maps to `sched_yield()`, and `TimeMsGet` is based on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`. Native software timers use `timer_create()` with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and `SIGEV_THREAD`; `timer_settime()` provides arm/disarm behavior for Start, Stop and Reset. Generated POSIX build scripts discover and link `Threads::Threads` and request `_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L`.

Portable pthreads provide no direct suspend/resume primitive with the required OSAL semantics, so `ThreadSuspend` and `ThreadResume` remain explicit runtime-unsupported operations. The generic critical-section primitive is retained for backward compatibility but is deprecated because it represents system-level interrupt/scheduler masking rather than component-scoped synchronization. Portable POSIX user space cannot provide equivalent interrupt-masking semantics, so the POSIX backend reports `TEMPLATE_OSAL_PORT_SPECIFIC_ERR` for critical-section Enter/Exit; component code should use mutexes for ordinary critical regions.

## FreeRTOS port instance parameters

The generated FreeRTOS port supports optional per-instance policy parameters. Passing `NULL` to the FreeRTOS initialization function selects the default port policy. A non-`NULL` parameter structure is validated before any override is applied; invalid explicitly supplied parameters cause initialization to fail rather than being silently replaced by defaults.

Thread priorities use the generic OSAL levels `LOW`, `NORMAL`, `HIGH` and `CRITICAL`. The default mapping is defined by the `TEMPLATE_OSAL_FREERTOS_THREAD_PRIO_*` macros. An instance-specific mapping must satisfy all of the following conditions:

- `LOW` must be above `tskIDLE_PRIORITY`;
- every mapped priority must be below `configMAX_PRIORITIES`;
- priorities must be strictly ordered as `LOW < NORMAL < HIGH < CRITICAL`.

When `TEMPLATE_OSAL_FREERTOS_USE_SMP` is enabled, an instance may additionally provide a thread-slot-to-core-affinity policy. Affinity masks are validated against the number of cores exposed by the selected FreeRTOS port.

When `TEMPLATE_OSAL_FREERTOS_USE_MPU` is enabled, the instance may provide one common set of `MemoryRegion_t` regions for the port. The regions are shared policy parameters for the instance rather than per-thread-slot configuration. Validation rejects zero-sized regions, address-range overflow and overlapping regions. For recognized Arm MPU models the port also checks the architecture-specific size and alignment constraints. MPU model detection is based on capabilities exposed by the selected FreeRTOS headers; an otherwise unknown MPU model requires `TEMPLATE_OSAL_FREERTOS_MPU_REGION_PLATFORM_VALIDATE(region)` to be supplied.

The generic infinite timeout remains `TEMPLATE_OSAL_INFINITY_TOUT`. The FreeRTOS implementation converts it directly to the native `portMAX_DELAY`; no separate FreeRTOS infinity constant is introduced.

## Generated resources and formatter

Source execution resolves resources from:

```text
generator/resources/templates/osal/
generator/resources/kiwicgen-clang-format.yaml
```

Standalone execution resolves external resources relative to the executable directory:

```text
dist/
├── kiwicgen[.exe]
├── kiwicgen-gui[.exe]
├── templates/
│   └── osal/
├── kiwicgen-clang-format.yaml
├── tools/
│   └── clang-format[.exe]
├── doc/
├── README.md
├── kiwicgen-README.md
└── LICENSE
```

## Building standalone executables

Build helpers live in `generator/scripts/` and resolve their default build/dist directories relative to their own location.

Windows CMD:

```bat
generator\scripts\build-exe.bat
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
generator\scripts\build-exe.ps1
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
generator/scripts/build-exe.sh
```

Optional arguments:

```text
--python <path>
--build-dir <path>
--dist-dir <path>
```

The build uses an isolated `build/venv`, stages packaging input under `build/`, installs build dependencies there, builds both frontends with PyInstaller and then stages external runtime resources.

The build scripts finish with a distribution smoke test: they run `kiwicgen --version`, perform a real FreeRTOS OSAL generation using the final executable and verify that the expected generated header exists.

## Development checks

At minimum, before handing off a generator change:

```bash
python -m compileall -q generator/core generator/formatter generator/cli generator/gui
python generator/cli/main.py --help
python generator/cli/main.py --version
```

A functional smoke check should also load a profile or run a representative FreeRTOS generation. Changes affecting distribution/build behavior should run the platform build helper when the current environment supports it.
