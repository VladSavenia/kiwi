# KIWI Testing

KIWI has a GitHub Actions verification pipeline built around a small set of high-value checks: the generator itself must build and run, a full-set OSAL must be generated for both implemented ports, the generated C sources must compile and link, and the generated sources must pass static analysis. More focused unit and integration tests remain planned.


## GitHub Actions pipeline

The repository contains a four-stage workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```text
generator-check
      |
      v
generate-full-set
      |
      v
build-generated
      |
      v
static-analysis
```

The `generate-full-set` stage generates both FreeRTOS and POSIX ports and enables every currently exposed OSAL primitive group:

- queue;
- stream buffer;
- mutex;
- semaphore;
- event flags;
- thread;
- critical section;
- software timer;
- time;
- memory.

The generated source tree is passed between jobs as a workflow artifact. The build stage checks out the official `FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel` repository at the pinned `V11.3.1` tag and builds the generated FreeRTOS backend against the real `GCC_POSIX` simulator port. A CI-only `FreeRTOSConfig.h` supplies the kernel configuration required by the generated API set, while the FreeRTOS kernel itself, its POSIX port, heap implementation, queue/event/stream-buffer/timer code and native headers all come from the upstream FreeRTOS release. The same build also compiles and links the generated native POSIX backend against the host pthread/POSIX facilities.

The build uses CMake and links separate small host executables against the generated FreeRTOS and POSIX libraries. This intentionally goes beyond syntax-only compilation: unresolved native dependencies in either backend become link failures. The native POSIX smoke executable is also run and checks initialization/deinitialization, explicit thread yield, and the expected runtime-unsupported result for the deprecated system-level critical-section primitive. The generated targets are compiled with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.

The static-analysis stage checks the generic source plus both generated backends. It runs GCC `-fanalyzer` for the generic, FreeRTOS and POSIX translation units and runs `cppcheck` across the same generated source set. MPU and SMP are not enabled in the host FreeRTOS build because the FreeRTOS POSIX simulator is neither an MPU port nor an SMP target; their port-specific validation remains covered at source-contract level rather than being faked by CI-only FreeRTOS stubs.

## Why component-scoped OSAL is test-friendly

A component-scoped OSAL gives every component a small, explicit boundary around its operating-system dependencies. That boundary can be backed by FreeRTOS in production and by a host/test implementation during tests without changing the component itself.

```text
Production                         Test

Component                          Same Component
    |                                  |
    v                                  v
Component OSAL API                 Same OSAL API
    |                                  |
    v                                  v
Production backend                Test / host backend
    |                                  |
    v                                  v
Target RTOS                        x86 / Linux / Windows / CI
```

This allows component tests to run in an isolated environment on a platform that may be completely different from the final embedded target.

A test backend can also deliberately control conditions that are difficult to reproduce reliably on hardware, for example:

- queue full / empty conditions;
- queue receive timeouts;
- allocation failures;
- thread-creation failures;
- deterministic or accelerated time;
- controlled mutex behavior;
- backend error injection;
- resource leak and lifecycle violations.

The important property is that the component still uses its normal OSAL API. The test does not need to introduce test-only branches into the component or emulate the entire native RTOS API.

For the architectural rationale, see [`osal_architecture_en.md`](osal_architecture_en.md#14-testability-as-part-of-the-architecture).

## Planned test layers

The test strategy should eventually include several complementary layers:

- code-generation core unit tests;
- configuration normalization and validation tests;
- YAML profile load/save round-trip tests;
- deterministic/golden-file generation tests;
- CLI argument and exit-code tests;
- output-layout tests for every supported combination;
- generated C syntax/build checks;
- backend-specific tests for FreeRTOS and POSIX;
- host/test OSAL backend tests for component isolation;
- resource lifecycle/registry tests;
- timeout and execution-context semantic tests;
- deterministic failure-injection tests;
- assertion, tracing and error-path tests;
- regression tests for reported bugs.

GUI logic should remain thin enough that most behavior can be tested through the shared `generator/core/` pipeline. GUI-specific tests can then focus on frontend state mapping and profile interaction rather than duplicating generator tests.

## Host/test backend direction

A future test backend should implement the same generic semantic contract as a production backend, but it may deliberately expose extra control to the **test harness**, not to the component.

For example, the harness may configure the next allocation to fail or advance synthetic time. The component must still observe only ordinary OSAL results.

```text
Test harness
     |
     | configure deterministic behavior
     v
Test OSAL backend <----- Same generic OSAL contract ----- Component
```

This separation is important: test controls belong outside the component-facing API. Otherwise testability would leak test-specific behavior back into production component code.

## Current manual smoke test

The same checks can also be run manually from the repository root during local development.

Check Python syntax:

```bash
python -m compileall -q \
  generator/core \
  generator/formatter \
  generator/cli \
  generator/gui
```

Check CLI help/no-argument behavior:

```bash
python generator/cli/main.py
python generator/cli/main.py --help
```

Neither command should generate files.

Perform a sample generation into a temporary output directory:

```bash
python generator/cli/main.py \
  --module-prefix=foo_module \
  --port=FreeRTOS \
  --use-thread-api \
  --use-queue-api \
  --output=./generated_smoke
```

Then verify that the expected module tree is produced and that disabled API groups are not present in generated sources.

Profile round-trip, deterministic output and host/test backend checks will be converted into automated tests as the test infrastructure is introduced.
