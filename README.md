# KIWI OSAL Code Generator

KIWI is a code generator for building **component-scoped Operating System Abstraction Layers (OSALs)** for embedded software. It generates a small OS-facing interface tailored to the needs of a particular component instead of forcing the whole project through one large system-wide abstraction.

The project is intended to make component code easier to port, test and maintain while keeping direct FreeRTOS, POSIX and other OS-specific dependencies behind generated OSAL boundaries.

## Why OSAL and why component-scoped?

A component-scoped OSAL gives a component a small, stable and unambiguous contract for the OS services it actually uses. It also provides a natural test boundary, allowing the same component to run against a production backend or an isolated host/test implementation.

For the architectural model, unified OS primitive semantics, ownership rules and testability rationale, see [`doc/osal_architecture_en.md`](doc/osal_architecture_en.md). A Russian version is available in [`doc/osal_architecture_ru.md`](doc/osal_architecture_ru.md).

## Code generator

KIWI provides both CLI and GUI frontends over the same code-generation core. YAML profiles can be used to save and reproduce generation settings.

For CLI options, GUI controls, profiles, output layouts and executable builds, see [`doc/kiwicgen.md`](doc/kiwicgen.md).

## Examples

Usage examples for the generated generic OSAL API are collected in [`doc/examples.md`](doc/examples.md). The examples are currently a placeholder and will be expanded as the API is stabilized.

## Supported ports

| Target | Language | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FreeRTOS | C | Implemented | Queues, stream buffers, mutexes, counting semaphores, event flags, threads including explicit `Yield`, deprecated system-level critical sections, software timers, time and memory |
| POSIX | C | Implemented | Queues, stream buffers, recursive mutexes, counting semaphores, event flags, threads including `Yield` and `DelayUntil`, native software timers, monotonic time and memory; thread suspend/resume and system-level critical sections are unsupported |
| C++ OSAL variant | C++ | Planned | C++ generation/port support is on the roadmap |

## Testing

A four-stage GitHub Actions pipeline checks the generator, generates the full OSAL API set for FreeRTOS and POSIX, builds and links the generated FreeRTOS port against the official FreeRTOS `GCC_POSIX` host port as well as the native POSIX port, and runs static analysis. See [`doc/testing.md`](doc/testing.md) for the current CI flow and the broader testing model.

Contributions are welcome, including new ports, tests, examples, generator improvements, documentation and OSAL API extensions.
